# Rust Code Challenges: Challenge 10

Your challenge is to parse two strings as dates,
then calculate the number of whole weeks between them.

## Testing your solution
Use `cargo add chrono`.
Use `cargo test` to evaluate yourself:

```console
$ cargo test
...
running 3 tests
test one_week ... ok
test past ... ok
test same_day ... ok
...
```
