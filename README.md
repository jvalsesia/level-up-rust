# Level Up Rust: Challenge 8

Your challenge is to implement code to convert between two temperature 
scales: celsius and fahrenheit. 

To make this more challenging than implementing the mathematical formula,
you will need to work with an intermediate type that encodes the temperature.

## Testing your solution

Use `cargo test` to evaluate yourself:

```console
$ cargo test
...
```
